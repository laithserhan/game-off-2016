# GitHub Game Off 2016

![GitHub Game Off 2016 Theme is Hacking, Modding, or Augmenting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121322/19498019/d8827370-9543-11e6-82d8-6da822b6147b.png)

## The Challenge

*I* have the entire month of November to create a game *loosely* based on the theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting**.

What do[es] _Github_ mean by **loosely** based on hacking, modding and/or augmenting? They literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be:

* an endless runner where you *hack* down binary trees in your path with a pixelated axe,
* a *modern* take on a classic e.g. a roguelike set in a 3D or VR world, or
* an *augmented* reality game bringing octopus/cat hybrids into the real world.

*I'm going to* work *alone* ~~or with a team~~ and build for (some as-of-yet undecided) platform or device. The use of open source game engines and libraries is encouraged but not required.

_Github_ will highlight some of _their_ favorites on the GitHub blog, and the world will get to enjoy (and maybe even contribute to and/or learn from) _my_ creation~~s~~.

## How to participate

* ~~[Sign up for a free personal account][github-signup] if you don't already have one.~~
* ~~Fork [this repository][game-off-repo] to _my_ personal account (or to a [free organization account][github-signup-org]).~~
* ~~Clone the repository on _my_ computer~~ and build _my_ game.
* Push _my_ game source code to _my_ forked repository before Dec 1st.
* Update the `README.md` file to include a description of _my_ game, how/where to play/download it, how to build/compile it, what dependencies it has, etc.
* Submit _my_ final game using this [form][wufoo-form].
